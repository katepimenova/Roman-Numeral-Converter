##The Problem

We need to create "Angular 2" based application that will convert an integer into Roman Numerals.

## Demo

https://katepimenova.github.io/angular2-roman-numeral-converter/

## What is being used 

[Angular 2](https://angular.io/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
